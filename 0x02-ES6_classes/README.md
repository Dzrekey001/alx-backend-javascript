# ES6 Classes Curriculum Project

This repository contains a series of tasks focusing on ES6 classes, object-oriented programming (OOP), and related concepts. Each task is designed to reinforce understanding and implementation of various aspects of ES6 classes in JavaScript.
## Task Descriptions

1. **Implementing a Class:** 
   - Implement a class named `ClassRoom` with a specified prototype and attributes.

2. **Creating Class Instances:** 
   - Import the `ClassRoom` class and implement a function named `initializeRooms` to create instances of `ClassRoom`.

3. **Getters and Setters:** 
   - Implement a class named `HolbertonCourse` with getter and setter methods for its attributes.

4. **Methods and Static Methods:** 
   - Implement a class named `Currency` with methods and a static method.

5. **Abstract Classes and Error Handling:** 
   - Implement a class named `Building` as an abstract class with a requirement for subclasses to implement a specific method.

6. **Inheritance:** 
   - Implement a subclass named `SkyHighBuilding` that extends the `Building` class.

7. **Default String Description:** 
   - Implement a class named `Airport` with a default string description.

8. **Primitive Conversion:** 
   - Implement a class named `HolbertonClass` that can be cast into different primitive types.

9. **Hoisting and Fixing Code:** 
   - Fix a code snippet related to hoisting and class definitions.

10. **Using Symbols:** 
    - Implement a class named `Car` with a method `cloneCar` that uses symbols.
