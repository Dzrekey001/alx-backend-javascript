**ES6 Basics**
***
This repository contains solutions to various tasks focused on mastering ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) concepts and syntax. Each task is designed to enhance understanding and proficiency in using ES6 features in JavaScript.

**Task 0: Const or let?**
In this task, variables are instantiated using const and let instead of var.
***
**Task 1: Block Scope**
Variables inside the function are modified to avoid overwriting inside the conditional block.
***
**Task 2: Arrow functions**
The standard function is rewritten to use ES6's arrow syntax.
***
**Task 3: Parameter defaults**
The internals of the function are condensed to 1 line using default parameter values for function parameters.
***
**Task 4: Rest parameter syntax for functions**
The function is modified to return the number of arguments passed to it using the rest parameter syntax.
***
**Task 5: The wonders of spread syntax**
Arrays and a string are concatenated using spread syntax.
***
**Task 6: Take advantage of template literals**
The return statement is rewritten using a template literal to substitute defined variables.
***
**Task 7: Object property value shorthand syntax**
The function's budget object is modified to use key names instead of explicitly defining them.
***
**Task 8: No need to create empty objects before adding in properties**
The function is rewritten to use ES6 computed property names on the budget object.
***
**Task 9: ES6 method properties**
The function is rewritten to use ES6 method properties in the fullBudget object.
***
**Task 10: For...of Loops**
The function is rewritten to use ES6's for...of operator instead of var.
***
**Task 11: Iterator**
A function named createEmployeesObject is created to return an object with the given format.
***
**Task 12: Let's create a report object**
A function named createReportObject is created to return an object containing all employees and a method to get the number of departments.
***


Note: Each task is accompanied by its own set of files for implementation and testing.
